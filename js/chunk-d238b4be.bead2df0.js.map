So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n    \n    \n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n    \n      ```js\n      let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n    \n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n    \n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n    \n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n    \n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    \n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n    \n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n    \n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n    \n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n    \n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n    \n      @class Promise\n      @param {Function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    var Promise$1 = function () {\n        function Promise(resolver) {\n            this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n            this._result = this._state = undefined;\n            this._subscribers = [];\n            if (noop !== resolver) {\n                typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n                this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n            }\n        }\n        /**\n        The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n        which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n        reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n         ```js\n        findUser().then(function(user){\n          // user is available\n        }, function(reason){\n          // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n        });\n        ```\n         Chaining\n        --------\n         The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n        promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n        or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n         ```js\n        findUser().then(function (user) {\n          return user.name;\n        }, function (reason) {\n          return 'default name';\n        }).then(function (userName) {\n          // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n          // will be `'default name'`\n        });\n         findUser().then(function (user) {\n          throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n        }, function (reason) {\n          throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n        }).then(function (value) {\n          // never reached\n        }, function (reason) {\n          // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n          // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n        });\n        ```\n        If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n         ```js\n        findUser().then(function (user) {\n          throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n        }).then(function (value) {\n          // never reached\n        }).then(function (value) {\n          // never reached\n        }, function (reason) {\n          // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n        });\n        ```\n         Assimilation\n        ------------\n         Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n        retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n        fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n        until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n         ```js\n        findUser().then(function (user) {\n          return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n        }).then(function (comments) {\n          // The user's comments are now available\n        });\n        ```\n         If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n         ```js\n        findUser().then(function (user) {\n          return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n        }).then(function (comments) {\n          // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n        }, function (reason) {\n          // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n        });\n        ```\n         Simple Example\n        --------------\n         Synchronous Example\n         ```javascript\n        let result;\n         try {\n          result = findResult();\n          // success\n        } catch(reason) {\n          // failure\n        }\n        ```\n         Errback Example\n         ```js\n        findResult(function(result, err){\n          if (err) {\n            // failure\n          } else {\n            // success\n          }\n        });\n        ```\n         Promise Example;\n         ```javascript\n        findResult().then(function(result){\n          // success\n        }, function(reason){\n          // failure\n        });\n        ```\n         Advanced Example\n        --------------\n         Synchronous Example\n         ```javascript\n        let author, books;\n         try {\n          author = findAuthor();\n          books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n          // success\n        } catch(reason) {\n          // failure\n        }\n        ```\n         Errback Example\n         ```js\n         function foundBooks(books) {\n         }\n         function failure(reason) {\n         }\n         findAuthor(function(author, err){\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n            // failure\n          } else {\n            try {\n              findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n                if (err) {\n                  failure(err);\n                } else {\n                  try {\n                    foundBooks(books);\n                  } catch(reason) {\n                    failure(reason);\n                  }\n                }\n              });\n            } catch(error) {\n              failure(err);\n            }\n            // success\n          }\n        });\n        ```\n         Promise Example;\n         ```javascript\n        findAuthor().\n          then(findBooksByAuthor).\n          then(function(books){\n            // found books\n        }).catch(function(reason){\n          // something went wrong\n        });\n        ```\n         @method then\n        @param {Function} onFulfilled\n        @param {Function} onRejected\n        Useful for tooling.\n        @return {Promise}\n        */\n        /**\n        `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n        as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n        ```js\n        function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n        }\n        // synchronous\n        try {\n        findAuthor();\n        } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n        }\n        // async with promises\n        findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n        });\n        ```\n        @method catch\n        @param {Function} onRejection\n        Useful for tooling.\n        @return {Promise}\n        */\n        Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n            return this.then(null, onRejection);\n        };\n        /**\n          `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n          try/catch/finally behaves\n        \n          Synchronous example:\n        \n          ```js\n          findAuthor() {\n            if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n              throw new Error();\n            }\n            return new Author();\n          }\n        \n          try {\n            return findAuthor();
